Synopsis
========

The client is working on a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testbed application for
satellite avionics that **requires an FPGA on their custom test hardware to
communicate with their Flat-Sat UUT.**

They've already developed and verified their custom hardware, and need design
engineers to implement the logic needed to stimulate their UUT's
high-reliability bespoke interfaces.

   The *Synopsis* section is where a (very) high-level overview of the project can
   be written, to give context to all applicable personnel who may know nothing
   about it
