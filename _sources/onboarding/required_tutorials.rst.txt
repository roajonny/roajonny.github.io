Required Tutorials
==================

After confirming the virtual environment is active and having navigated to your
sandbox, start going through the official `Sphinx Tutorial
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_, as it's
foundational to working w/ rST and being productive with the other Sphinx
extensions.

Then, go through the following sequence of tutorials: 

#. `Sphinx-Needs Tutorial <https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_
#. `Mermaid Tutorial <https://mermaid.js.org/intro/getting-started.html>`_
#. `Wavedrom Tutorial <https://wavedrom.com/tutorial.html>`_ 

This will provide you with the background required to start making sense of the
documentation template's directory structure and source files to start
modifying it.
