   *High-Level Requirements* are the customer requirements which serve as the
   "handshake" between the customer and the design team about what the product
   is unambiguously supposed to do

   *Key Requirements* could be requirements that are received from a system
   specification which need to be flowed down to FPGA requirements proper

   Regardless of what nomenclature convention is adopted for a project, either
   one will likely have flowdown to their complementary requirements in the
   :doc:`low_level_reqs` section
