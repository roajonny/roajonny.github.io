Motivations
===========

Hi there,

I decided to put this wiki together in the interest of improving the
efficacy and quality-of-life of FPGA engineering.

*  It demonstrates a **"Docs-as-Code" philosophy**, which tightly couples design
   code with its documentation (as code) under the same version control system,
   creating a single source of truth
*  It promotes a **scalable, Git-based FPGA workflow** that enables code
   maintainability, minimizing the potential for siloes/tribal knowledge and
   increasing bus factor
*  It modernizes FPGA development practices by **leveraging SW tools and
   methodologies** that are effective, robust, and standard in the SW world
*  It provides a **convenient template as a starting point for FPGA projects,**
   which is intended to be simple to understand and straightforward to leverage

This is to say, simply, that it **establishes an infrastructure for effortless
collaboration, encouraging the de-centralization of knowledge and writing
high-quality documentation as part of the FPGA development process.**

Lots of love went into this - I hope you find it useful!
