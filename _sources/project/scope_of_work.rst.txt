         The FPGA needs to implement two UART interfaces over external RS422 and
         LVDS ICs, which are controllable by host software over PCI-Express

The :doc:`../requirements/high_level_reqs` section captures the customer's
high-level needs in requirements format.

.. note::
   
   The *Scope-of-Work* is a general description of what the customer is asking
   for - this information is captured in a Sphinx-Needs "object" and is the
